    "## First solution (Basic one): n-gram based language models\n",
    "\n",
    "An **n-gram language model** has both advantages and disadvantages, as well as core principles that guide its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Principle:**\n",
    "- The model assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the previous 'n' words, ignoring longer context or sentence structure.\n",
    "- It estimates conditional probabilities by counting the occurrences of word sequences (n-grams) in training data.\n",
    "- The formula for estimating probability is based on the frequency of the n-gram and (n+1)-gram counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: N-gram models are easy to understand and implement, requiring only word counts to estimate probabilities.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: They can be trained quickly with relatively low computational resources compared to more complex models like neural networks.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: N-gram models can handle large corpora efficiently as they are based on frequency counts.\n",
    "4. **Adaptability**: They can capture some level of local context (within the n preceding words), providing a practical balance between context and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Data Sparsity**: As n increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially, leading to sparse data. Many n-grams may never appear in the training data, making probability estimation unreliable.\n",
    "2. **Limited Context**: N-gram models have a fixed context window (the previous 'n' words). This limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies or deeper syntactic and semantic relationships in language.\n",
    "3. **Zero Probability for Unseen Words**: Without smoothing, the model assigns zero probability to word sequences that are not seen in training, which can lead to poor performance on unseen data.\n",
    "4. **Storage and Computational Cost**: For higher values of n, storing and computing n-gram probabilities can become expensive in terms of memory and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, n-gram models are simple and efficient but struggle with sparsity and capturing long-term dependencies in language."
